## Project Overview <a name="overview"></a>
For this project, we're gonna create an AWS EC2 instance using Terraform, and then installing jenkins to integrate GitHub Repository to it.

[__AWS EC2__](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/?ec2-whats-new.sort-by=item.additionalFields.postDateTime&ec2-whats-new.sort-order=desc) -> Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) is a web service that provides secure, resizable compute capacity in the cloud. It is designed to make web-scale cloud computing easier for developers. Amazon EC2’s simple web service interface allows you to obtain and configure capacity with minimal friction. It provides you with complete control of your computing resources and lets you run on Amazon’s proven computing environment.

[__Terraform__](https://medium.com/nerd-for-tech/deploying-aws-resources-using-terraform-and-jenkins-pipeline-1c706f1a2e7c) -> HashiCorp Terraform is a tool for building, changing, and versioning infrastructure that has an open-source and enterprise version. Unlike AWS CloudFormation, which can only be used on AWS, Terraform is cloud agnostic and can be used to create multi-cloud infrastructure as well as on-prem. It’s written in a human readable, machine consumable language called HashiCorp Configuration Language (HCL).

[__Jenkins__](https://medium.com/nerd-for-tech/deploying-aws-resources-using-terraform-and-jenkins-pipeline-1c706f1a2e7c) -> Jenkins is a self-contained, open source automation server used to automate tasks associated with building, testing, and delivering/deploying software. Jenkins Pipeline implements continuous deliver pipelines into Jenkins through use of plugins and a Jenkinsfile. The Jenkinsfile can be Declarative or Scripted and contains a list of steps for the pipeline to follow.
